## A Simple Server with Node.js Express

This is a simple skeleton Express server project that works on any of the raspberry pi 3 devices.

This project simply serves up `"Hello World!"` on port `:80` of your device.

To get this project up and running, you will need to pull the automatic built image locally:
```
$ docker pull motou/pi_nodejs
```
